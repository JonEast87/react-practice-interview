### Instructions

This is an empty React project generated from `create-react-app`. 

To complete this assignment, your app will need to achieve the following:

1. Upon first loading, it will display a list of usernames retrieved from an API, with a button labeled "Show Todos"
1. When the user clicks on a "Show Todos" button for a specific user, it will add a list of Todos to the display. This will require a second API call for the Todos.
1. A button labeled "Toggle filter" will toggle between showing only incomplete todos and showing ALL todos.
1. When the Todos first load, they will default to showing ONLY incomplete todos.
